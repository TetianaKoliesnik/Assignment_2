## OOP Pharmacy Manager

### Description
A school project to practice the basics of Object-oriented Programming in JavaScript, as well as practicing using Git to manage the project.

For this I developed a class-based “Pharmacy Inventory Management System”. The application allows users to enter data about different medicines, delete data, store the data, and display it.
