<!-- 
	decided not to include dosage when displaying all products

	dosage should be rendered when displaying tablets, liquids, creams

	elements of the added arrays show up in a random order (in the console)

	products should not dissapear on refresh (local storage)

	Rendered products info should start with capital letter (because ugly)

	rendered date should look dd/mm/yyyy

	Form validation must be implemented. Meaning, it is mandatory for users to fill 
out all the fields. In addition, the validation must prevent users from entering 
two products with the same product ID.

Form validation does not work on product type
