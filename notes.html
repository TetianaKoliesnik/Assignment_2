<!-- 
	1 products should not dissapear on refresh (local storage)

	2 when deleting a product in all tab, the same product must be automatically deleted in the corresponding tab. And vice versa
(i think they are deleted, just not rendered)

	3 Rendered products info should start with capital letter (because ugly)

	4 rendered date should look dd/mm/yyyy

	5 Form validation must be implemented. Meaning, it is mandatory for users to fill 
out all the fields. In addition, the validation must prevent users from entering 
two products with the same product ID.

	Form validation does not work on product type

	6 add template literals to the dosage/use times per day
