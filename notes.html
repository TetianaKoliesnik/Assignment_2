<!-- 

	2 when deleting a product in a tablets/liquids/creams tab, 
	the same product must be automatically deleted in the all tab
	(i think they are deleted, just not rendered)

	3 Rendered products info should start with capital letter (because ugly)

	4 rendered date should look dd/mm/yyyy

	5 Form validation must be implemented. Meaning, it is mandatory for users to fill 
out all the fields. In addition, the validation must prevent users from entering 
two products with the same product ID.


	10 date should be in the future

	11 when deleting in all tab product must disappear in the active tab right away, without refresh (other tabs are fine)
